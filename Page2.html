    <h1>The Causes Of Climate Change</h1>
    <p> There are many different ways that climate change is caused. So here are some of the main causes of climate
      change. </p>
  </section>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="course-col">
      <h3>Burning Fossil Fuels</h3>
      <p> Fossil fuels, especially in America, are the biggest reason why climate change is so bad. America alone
        contributes 14% of gas emissions in the entire world, which puts us in the top 3 countries that emit gas into
        the atmosphere. The debate over the solutions to climate change has been debated for years, and now we are
        seeing the effects of it. 2023 breaks a record for being the warmest year on record. If last summer was super
        hot, wait until you see it this summer. </p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="course-col">
        <h3>Deforestaion/Forest Fires</h3>
        <p> Deforestation/Forest Fires is another big issue that needs to be addressed. Trees are a storage for carbon
          dioxide, which is what we need to survive, but when thousands of trees are being cut down. It releases that
          carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. We saw what happened when Canada had a huge forest fire that traveled to
          America. The effects of the forest fires were so bad that schools were forced to close.

        <div class="course-col">
          <h3>Industry</h3>
          <p> Many industries are again another major problem that needs fixing. Industries around the country emit
            a long range of greenhouse gasses into the air. One example is when oil companies go bankrupt, they
            leave hundreds of oil wells wide open. Releasing large amounts of methane into the air, which is much
            worse than other gasses.

        <h1>The Effects Of Climate Change</h1>
        <p> With the rise of climate change, its no suprise there will be negative effects on the world. So here are a
          few
          of them</p>
      </section>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="course-col">
          <h3>Warming Tempatures and Wildfires</h3>
          <p> Warming temperatures, The temperature in the United States is rising every year and we see that with each
            summer that goes by. For example, 2023 broke a record for having the warmest year ever recorded. Which isnâ€™t
            surprising since we have avoided this issue. Just wait for the 2024s summer. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Ecosystems </h3>
            <p> Ecosystems are also being affected by climate change, one of the most common ecosystems is the ice
              glaciers
              in the Antarctic that are home to the polar bears. With the temperature rise, more and more ice is
              being melted, leaving hundreds of polar bears needing a new home.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="course-col">
              <h3>Winter </h3>
              <p> Connecting back to rising temperatures we see a large decrease in snow these past years. The amount of
                snow is nothing compared to previous years, last year it only snowed about 2 inches which is insane.
                With the continued increase in temp, it might stop snowing at all in nyc.

              <h1>What You Can Do To Prevent Climate Change</h1>
              <p> It's no surprise that climate change is now having an impact on the world and the years of damages
                cannot be
                instantly reversed but there is still hope. This is why, we as the people need to step up and stop
                contributing to
                the rise in climate change. So here are a few ways you can do to help.
              </p>

              <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Sustainable transportation:</h3>
                <p> Climate change has been at its highest, it's ever been. This is why America especially should be
                  striving for
                  cleaner transportation. Things like walking, taking a bike, even carpooling, or taking public
                  transportation
                  rather than driving in a car by yourself can help. You might be surprised but yes, trains and buses
                  are a great
                  way to reduce fossil fuel because you are saving more fuel per person than just driving your car. </p>
              </div>

                <div class="course-col">
                  <h3>Conserving Energy & Water.</h3>

                  <p>Conserving is another great and easy way you can do to prevent climate change. Have you ever left
                    the water
                    running or left something on while you went to do something else? well, that is a great place to
                    start, try to
                    reduce the amount of water and energy you are using. That way you not only reduce your part in
                    climate change
                    but also save money.
                  </p>

                    <h3>Raising Awareness/Taking Action. </h3>
                    <p> Raising awareness/taking action is one of the best ways to help with climate change. Over the
                      years
                      protests have caused many things to change for the better so protesting for cleaner energy and
                      cleaner
                      transportation can help in the long run. Yes, it might take a while but its still worth trying
                    </p>
