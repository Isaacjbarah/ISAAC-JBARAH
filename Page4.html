    <h1>What You Can Do To Prevent Climate Change</h1>
    <p> It's no surprise that climate change is now having an impact on the world and the years of damages cannot be
      instantly reversed but there is still hope. This is why, we as the people need to step up and stop contributing to
      the rise in climate change. So here are a few ways you can do to help.

      <h3>Sustainable transportation:</h3>
      <p> Climate change has been at its highest, it's ever been. This is why America especially should be striving for
        cleaner transportation. Things like walking, taking a bike, even carpooling, or taking public transportation
        rather than driving in a car by yourself can help. You might be surprised but yes, trains and buses are a great
        way to reduce fossil fuel because you are saving more fuel per person than just driving your car. </p>

        <h3>Conserving Energy & Water.</h3>

        <p>Conserving is another great and easy way you can do to prevent climate change. Have you ever left the water
          running or left something on while you went to do something else? well, that is a great place to start, try to
          reduce the amount of water and energy you are using. That way you not only reduce your part in climate change
          but also save money.

          <h3>Raising Awareness/Taking Action. </h3>
          <p> Raising awareness/taking action is one of the best ways to help with climate change. Over the years
            protests have caused many things to change for the better so protesting for cleaner energy and cleaner
            transportation can help in the long run. Yes, it might take a while but its still worth trying
